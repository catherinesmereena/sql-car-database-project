# sql-car-database-project
SQL-based relational car database project involving data modeling, normalization to 3NF, ERD generation, and analytical query execution using MySQL.
Car Database Design & SQL Analytics (Normalization + Querying)

This repository showcases two end-to-end SQL assignments focused on designing, analyzing, and optimizing a relational database for car data using MySQL. It demonstrates foundational and advanced SQL skills, including query writing, data aggregation, normalization, and ERD modeling.

##   Overview

###  1: SQL Querying & Insights
- Built a structured car database from a raw dataset
- Wrote queries using `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, and `MAX` to extract business insights
- Analyzed trends in fuel efficiency, horsepower, and origin across model years

###  2: Database Design & Normalization
- Normalized the car dataset into 3NF to eliminate redundancy and improve integrity
- Created relational tables for Cars, Model, Specifications, Origin, and Performance
- Designed an ERD in MySQL Workbench and implemented the schema using SQL
- Used `JOIN` and subqueries to extract multi-table insights

##  Files Included
- `SQL_Assignment1_Report.docx` – SQL-based insights and query explanations  
- `SQL_Assignment2_Report.docx` – Normalization documentation and schema design  
- `Normalized_Cars_SQL_Script.sql` – Executable SQL schema for the normalized database

---

##  Summary
This project demonstrates core competencies in database design, SQL querying, and relational modeling. It reflects practical experience in transforming raw datasets into normalized schemas and extracting valuable insights through analytical queries.
